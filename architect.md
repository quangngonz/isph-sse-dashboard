Okay, I can help you design the admin dashboard for your ISPH Stock Exchange project. Here's a breakdown of the data to be shown, functionality to include, and other considerations, based on the provided code and project structure:

**I. Key Data to Display (Dashboard Overview)**

- **Overall System Status:**

    - **Server Status:** (Up/Down) - Maybe with a timestamp of the last server check.
    - **Number of Users:** Total, and broken down by role (students, teachers, admins).
    - **Number of Active Users:** (Users who have logged in within the last hour/day).
    - **Number of Stocks:** Total number of stocks available.
    - **Number of Pending Events:** Events created by teachers awaiting admin approval.
    - **Database Connection Status** (Optional): Indicate if the connection to the Firebase database is active.

- **Stock Market Overview:**

    - **Top Performing Stocks:** List of top 5-10 stocks with the highest positive price change (in percentage).
    - **Worst Performing Stocks:** List of top 5-10 stocks with the largest negative price change (in percentage).
    - **Most Traded Stocks:** List of top 5-10 stocks with the highest trading volume.
    - **Total Market Cap:** The sum of all individual stock market capitalizations.
    - **Average Stock Price:** The average price of all listed stocks.

    - **New User Signups:** Number of new users registered in the last day/week/month.

- **Event Summary:**
    - **Approved Events:** A brief overview of recently approved events (last 5) and their impact.
    - **Unapproved Events:** Number of events awaiting approval.

**II. Admin Functionality**

- **Event Management:**

    - **Event Approval Queue:**
        - A table displaying all pending events with details:
            - Event ID
            - Event Name
            - Description
            - Created By (Teacher ID/Name)
            - Timestamp
            - Stocks Impacted (or Houses)
            - Teacher's Evaluation (if provided)
        - Actions:
            - **Approve:** Approve the event, triggering the stock price/volume update process.
            - **Reject:** Reject the event (maybe with an option to provide a reason).
            - **Edit:** Modify the event details before approval (e.g., adjust the evaluation).
            - **View Details:** Expand to see full event details, including the projected evaluation calculated by the system.
    - **Event History:**
        - A searchable/filterable table of all past events (approved, rejected, processed). Include the same details as the approval queue, plus the final processed evaluation.

- **Stock Management:**

    - **Stock List:**
        - A table displaying all stocks with key information:
            - Stock Ticker
            - Stock Name
            - Full Name
            - Current Price
            - Initial Price
            - Total Volume
            - Available Volume
            - Market Cap
            - Sector
        - Actions:
            - **Set Opening Price:** Update the initial price of a stock (ideally done before trading begins).
            - **Adjust Volume:** Increase/decrease the available volume of a stock.
            - **View Details:** See the full details of a stock, including price history (perhaps in a chart).

- **User Management:**

        - A table of all users with details:
            - User ID
            - Username
            - Full Name (if available)
            - House
            - Role (student, teacher, admin)
            - Points Balance
        - Actions:
            - **View Details:** View a user's profile, including portfolio, transaction history, etc.
            - **Edit Role:** Promote/demote users (e.g., make a student a teacher).
            - **Reset Points:** (Use with caution!) Reset a user's points balance if necessary.
            - **Create User:** Manually add a new user to the system.

- **Transaction Management:**
    - **Transaction Logs:** A searchable/filterable table displaying all transactions (similar to the "Recent Transactions" on the dashboard, but with full history).
    - Actions:
        - **View Details:** Expand to see more information about the transaction.
        - **Rollback (Optional):** This is complex! Potentially allow reversing a transaction (e.g., if it was made in error or due to a system bug). This would need careful consideration and robust logging.

**III. Data Visualization**

- **Stock Price Charts:**
    - Display line charts showing the price history of individual stocks.
    - Allow selecting different timeframes (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, all).
    - Possibly overlay event markers on the chart to show when events impacted the stock.
- **Portfolio Value Charts:**
    - Display line charts showing the overall value of a user's portfolio over time.
- **Trading Volume Bars:**
    - Use bar charts to represent the trading volume of stocks.
